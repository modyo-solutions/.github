# The .github repository

GitHub has many special repositories.

You might already be familiar with the `.github` directory in a repository. It houses workflows, templates, configurations, and some other files specific to a project.

But another special repository you can create is the `.github` repository. It acts as a fallback for all of your repositories that don't have an actual `.github` directory with configurations,  templates and other community health files.

Just note that the files inside a repository's `.github` directory will be chosen over the ones in the `.github` directory. For example, if my new-project repo has a `.github` directory with a  template inside, that will be used instead of the generic feature request template from the `.github` repo.

# The .github repository for an organization account

The `.github` repository on an organization account works just like the `.github` repository on a personal account â€“ except there is one difference.

Organizations can also have profile READMEs that show up on the organization page on GitHub. This README resides on the /profile directory of the organization's `.github` repository.
